# Airbnb beautifier
The simple userscript that makes Airbnb search results map bigger.

By default, Airbnb displays city map with a width of 40% of your screen. Using this script, you can increase the map to 70%, and get an incredible user experience.

I once spent the whole day trying to find an apartment with this little map area. The solution came from that pain. Enjoy!

## How does results map look like with this script? ##

Much better, huh?

## How to install ##
1. Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey extension for your browser to make userscripts work.
2. Open this userscript in [raw mode](https://github.com/docomoz/airbnb-beautifier/raw/master/airbnb-search-beautifier.user.js) and install in your browser.
